          <h3>The map</h3>
          <div class="container">
            <div class="text-column">
              <p>
                this part, we will describe the core of our game, what objects compose the game, how these objects 
                interact with each other, and what they can do.
                This game is a 2D maze where the player evolves in a map composed of multiple frames in an 8x8 square.
              </p>
              <p>Our map will be contained in this array, but not every square of the array contains a part of the map. 
                It will be generated so that the player may navigate randomly. Each room is connected to another.
                Each frame will have the same background but different layers of decoration. 
                It will have a base size of (1280x960px) The squares will each possibly have 4 exits. For example, 
                if the square on the left is a part of the map, there will be an exit on the right side of the square.
                </p>

              <p>Now we will talk about the main character.
                Our main character will have the ability to pick up objects to change characteristics. 
                He will also have basic stats that can be upgraded by leveling up. 
                The stats will have an impact on how much damage the character will inflict on enemies, 
                how much life he possesses, the damage taken by enemy hits, his speed, and other characteristics.

              <h3>Movement</h3>
              <p>Our hero can be moved in 8 different direction and you can control his movements with 4 keys on your keyboard.
                "W" to go North, "S" to go South, "A" to go West, "D" to go East. You can use a combination of 2 keys de pick 
                another direction. For example: "W" and "A" to go North-West.
              </p>
              <p>He will also have the ability to dash in on of those directions by pressing the "shift" key. The dash will allow our character to move 
                quickly in one direction and to gain an invincibilty state for a second.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <h3>States</h3>
          <div class="container">
              <div class="innerBlock">
              <p>Our main character will have several states. 
                Idle state:
                It’s the basic state when our hero doesn’t move.
                
                Moving state:
                It’s the state that our character has when he is moving.
                
                Invincible state:
                This state will be granted to our character for a short amount of time after dashing or after being hit.
                
                Attack state:
                This state is the state that our character has when he attacks. 
                Blocking state:
                This state is the state where our character uses a shield and blocks any hit.
                
                Dead state:
                This state is the state when the HP of our character reaches 0.
                
                
              </p>
              <h3>Statistics</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Health points :<br>
                  As long as this stat is greater than 0 our charachter will be alive. 
                  He can loose health points by getting hit by an ennemy, 
                  and increase health points by drinking a healing potion or interacting with a rest place 
                  (represented by a room with a fire). The amount of health points can be increased by adding points in “Vigor”.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  Stamina :<br>
                  Stamina is used by the character to do some specific actions, for example, when the character attacks, 
                  dashes, and blocks. When the character’s stamina reaches 0 the player can’t do any of the previous actions. 
                  To retrieve stamina points the player must wait a short amount of time without any action mentioned previously. 
                  The player will then start to retrieve the stamina back over time. 
                  If an action is performed during the retrieval of stamina this will interrupt the process. 
                  The number of stamina can be increased by adding points in “Constitution”.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  Strength :<br>
                  Strength can be increased by 1 point each time the player gains a level. 
                  This will add damage depending on the character’s attack power.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  Dexterity :<br>
                  Dexterity can be increased by 1 point each time the player gains a level. 
                  This will allow the character to move faster and will increase the distance of the dash.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  Vigor :<br>
                  Vigor can be increased by 1 point each time the player gains a level. 
                  Each Vigor point will increase the number of Health points of the character.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  Constitution :<br>
                  Constitution can be increased by 1 point each time the player gains a level. 
                  Each Constitution point will increase the number of Stamina points of the character.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  Armor :<br>
                  Armor is defined by the items the character carries. It will block enemy damage by a percent of its attack power.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  Attack power :<br>
                  The Attack power is defined by the weapon and the character’s Strength. 
                  This is the damage you will inflict on your enemies reduced by their own armor.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  Faith :<br>
                  This is the amount of faith the player has. Faith is the currency used to level up, 
                  it is the price of leveling up depending on the current level.
                </li>

              <p>The enemies will be generated in each room and will have different levels of strength. 
                Each enemy has 3 main statistics: attack power, health points, and armor. 
                Depending on its strength, it will drop a certain amount of “Faith”. Enemies will have a hitbox. 
                If their hitbox interacts with the hitbox of the character’s weapon, they will lose hp.
